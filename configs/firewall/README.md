# Firewall (Future)

Planned: pfSense/OPNsense as core gateway + VLANs + DHCP + VPN.

## Migration Plan (Draft)
- Move DHCP from router to firewall
- Define VLANs (e.g., mgmt, servers, IoT)
- Update switch port tagging
- Update default gateway for hosts

## Backups
- Export XML/backup bundle regularly
